# üå§Ô∏è Weather Modal & ML Training Integration

This guide explains the new weather modal functionality that integrates Open-Meteo weather data with the flood prediction ML model training.

## üöÄ Features

### Weather Modal
- **Location-based weather fetching**: Enter coordinates to get real-time weather data from Open-Meteo
- **Visual weather display**: Shows temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, and precipitation
- **ML model training**: Train the flood prediction model with location-specific weather data
- **Map integration**: Click anywhere on the map to get weather data for that location

### Integration Points
- **Dashboard**: Weather & Training button in the top-right corner
- **Map page**: Click-to-get-weather functionality and Weather & Training button
- **Python ML API**: Direct integration with the FastAPI training endpoint

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
# ML Model API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_MODEL_URL=http://localhost:8200
```

### 2. Start the Python ML Service
```bash
# Start the FastAPI ML service
python main.py
```

The service will run on `http://localhost:8200` by default.

## üì± Usage

### From Dashboard
1. Click the "Weather & Training" button in the top-right corner
2. Enter latitude and longitude coordinates
3. Click "Get Weather Data" to fetch current weather
4. Click "Train Model" to ingest weather data and retrain the ML model

### From Map
1. Click anywhere on the map to select a location
2. The weather modal will open with the clicked coordinates pre-filled
3. Follow the same steps as above

### Manual Location Input
1. Open the weather modal from either dashboard or map
2. Manually enter latitude and longitude coordinates
3. Fetch weather data and train the model

## üîÑ Workflow

### Weather Data Flow
```
User Input (Coordinates) 
    ‚Üì
Weather Modal
    ‚Üì
Open-Meteo API (via /api/weather)
    ‚Üì
Database Storage
    ‚Üì
Python ML Model Training
    ‚Üì
Model Retraining Complete
```

### Training Process
1. **Data Ingestion**: Weather data is fetched from Open-Meteo and stored in the database
2. **Model Training**: The Python ML service retrains the flood prediction model with the new data
3. **Success Feedback**: User receives confirmation of successful training

## üéØ API Endpoints

### Weather API (`/api/weather`)
- `GET /api/weather?latitude=X&longitude=Y&days_back=Z` - Fetch weather data
- `POST /api/weather` - Ingest weather data (current or historical)

### ML Model API (`http://localhost:8200`)
- `POST /retrain` - Retrain the flood prediction model
- `GET /health` - Check ML service health
- `GET /model/info` - Get model information

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ML Service Not Running**
   - Error: "Failed to retrain ML model"
   - Solution: Start the Python ML service with `python main.py`

2. **Invalid Coordinates**
   - Error: "Invalid coordinate range"
   - Solution: Ensure latitude is between -90 and 90, longitude between -180 and 180

3. **Weather Data Not Available**
   - Error: "No weather data available for this location"
   - Solution: Try a different location or check Open-Meteo API status

### Debug Mode
Open browser developer tools to see detailed logs of the weather fetching and training process.

## üîß Configuration

### Model URL Configuration
The weather modal uses the `NEXT_PUBLIC_MODEL_URL` environment variable to connect to the Python ML service. Default is `http://localhost:8200`.

### Weather Data Sources
- **Current Weather**: Fetched from Open-Meteo forecast API
- **Historical Weather**: Fetched from Open-Meteo historical API (last 30 days by default)
- **Training Data**: Stored in Supabase database and used for ML model training

## üìä Data Display

The weather modal displays:
- **Temperature**: Current temperature in Celsius
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity percentage
- **Pressure**: Atmospheric pressure in hPa
- **Wind Speed**: Wind speed in m/s
- **Wind Direction**: Wind direction with compass notation
- **Precipitation**: Precipitation amount in mm

## üéâ Success!

When training completes successfully, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ Green success message
- Confirmation that weather data was ingested
- Confirmation that the ML model was retrained
- Updated flood prediction capabilities for the specified location
